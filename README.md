# Voice activity detection (VAD) paper and code
Voice activity detection (VAD) is a technique to detect whether a sound signal belongs to speech or non-speech based on the statistical distribution of acoustic features. It plays an important role in front-end processing for various speech applications such as speech enhancement, robust speech recognition systems, and speaker recognition. Here, we have compiled several VAD-related research papers and some their corresponding codes, starting from 198*. Scholars and engineers in need can refer to them for learning purposes. Welcome anyone who is interested to add research papers.

Recently, I have been using a script to synthesize audio using an open-source noise dataset and clean speech dataset for the purpose of training and decoding in deep learning. This script will also be made open-source. Of course, if you have a better script, please feel free to contribute it to this project.

I like its MRCG feature to do experiments (this code is too old). : https://github.com/jtkim-kaist/VAD.git

I haven't tried this method, so I cannot assess its performance. If you have a need, you can try it: https://github.com/Cruze-Young/LTPD-VAD

TEN VAD is a real-time voice activity detection system designed for enterprise use, providing accurate frame-level speech activity detection. It shows superior precision compared to both WebRTC VAD and Silero VAD, which are commonly used in the industry. Additionally, TEN VAD offers lower computational complexity and reduced memory usage compared to Silero VAD. Meanwhile, the architecture's temporal efficiency enables rapid voice activity detection, significantly reducing end-to-end response and turn detection latency in conversational AI systems.
